    "## Regular Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression, often called a pattern, is **an expression used to specify a set of strings** required for a particular purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple way to specify a finite set of strings is to list its elements or members. <br>For example `{Doc1,1,Doc2,2,Doc3,3}`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "`{Doc1,Doc2,Doc3}` can be specified by the pattern `Doc(1|2|3)`. <br>We say that this pattern matches each of the two strings. [Lets check?](https://regex101.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> In most formalisms, if there exists at least one regular expression that matches a particular set then there exists an infinite number of other regular expressions that also match it, i.e. **the specification is not unique**.<br>\n",
    "For example, the string set `{Doc1,Doc2,Doc3}` can also be specified by the pattern `Doc\\d`.\n",

    "> `Maniteja123@gmail.com`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look for a pattern appearance in a piece of text; for example, check if either the word \"color\" or the word \"colour\" appears in a document with just **one scan**\n",
    "> `I like Red color and i am wearing a Red colour shirt`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract specific portions of a text; for example, extract the postal code of an address\n",
    "> `Mr John Smith. 132, My Street, Kingston, New York 12401.`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replace portions of text; for example, change the appearance of \"color\" with \"colour\"\n",
    "> `I like Red colour and i am wearing a Red colour shirt`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split a larger text into smaller pieces, for example, splitting a text by any appearance of the dot, comma, or newline characters\n",
